## Introduction

This is a piece I am writing at Arvind's class

I am doing this...

## My First Piece of R code

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(tidyverse)
library(ggformula)
library(babynames)
```

```{r}
babynames
```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name=="Aditi")
```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name=="Prathishta")
```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name=="Aditi") %>% 
  gf_line(n~year)
```

Aditi really clicked off in 1980 but why not before?

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name=="Adithi" | name=="Aditi")
```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name=="Adithi" | name=="Aditi") %>% 
   gf_line(n ~ year, color = ~name)


  
```
